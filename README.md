# The Lakes Project
Just making this project a project where I can practice my HTML, CSS and JS. 
Also, a way to make an own website without worrying about the hosting of a single page. 

The website is located here: https://yetanotherlurkeree.github.io/TheLakesProject/

For anyone visiting this page, thank you for visiting and have a beautiful day!
