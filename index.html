				<p>Hello and thanks for visiting this page. I thought it would be nice to have some sort of portfolio with some works. Fortunately, Github offers a functionality where one can host their webpage via their repositories. </p>
				<p>As a result, I have links to my resumes, where I just say what I have done and learned.</p>
